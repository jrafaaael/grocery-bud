The "Grocery Bud" is a project to register a shopping list with the products of your choice.

You must enter the name of the product / item in the text input and confirm with the "Submit" button. Next, the new item will be added to the list with the possibility of editing or deleting it. 

If your option is to edit the product name, the current name will be placed in the text entry so that it can be edited. Again, the change must be confirmed with the button now called "Edit". 

As a last option, there is the "Clear items" button whose function is to remove all the items from the list. 

"Grocery Bud" is a project inspired by the "Grocery Bud" project from the "Vanilla Javascript Projects" series of projects by John Smilga. The GitHub repository is https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects .
